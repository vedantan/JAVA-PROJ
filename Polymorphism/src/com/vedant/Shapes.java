//Types of polymorphism
// 1  -- compile time or static polymorphism
//       achived by method overloading
// 2  -- run time or dynamic polymorphism
//       achived by method overriding
//       method with same name and parameter but different body is called overriding
//    -- when final keyword is used we cannot use inheritance and


// wrapping up the implementation of the data member and method in a class is called encapluation
// -- encapluation focusus on internal working
// -- process of containing information
// hiding unnecessary  details  and showing valuable information is called abstraction
// -- abstraction focuses on external stuff
// -- process of gaining information
